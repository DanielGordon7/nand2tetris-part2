In 6 projects we build the software layers on top of the Hack computer.
The main idea is to build software to perform 2-tier compilation on a custom object-oriented language called Jack, which is based on Java.
The intermediary language is based on the Stack Machine arthitecture and only exists in an "imaginary computer", the Virtual Machine.
The abstraction is obtained with a stack data structure, and 8 memory segments. These abstractions all live in the RAM of the host machine.

In first 2 projects we write a program to translate from VM code to Hack Assembly code

**Project 7:** code Arithmetic/Logical and Memory Segments commands.

**Project 8:** code Branching and Function commands. This involves conditional statements in VM code and function declaration, calling, and return.
